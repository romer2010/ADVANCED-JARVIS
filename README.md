# Jarvis AI

Jarvis is an AI assistant that I built to perform various tasks and provide useful information. It can handle a wide range of queries, from answering general knowledge questions to assisting with more complex tasks like scheduling, reminders, and more!

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Jarvis understands and processes human language to provide intelligent responses.
- **Task Automation**: It can perform tasks like setting reminders, making calculations, and more.
- **Knowledge Base**: Jarvis has access to a vast array of knowledge to answer general queries.
- **Custom Commands**: You can teach Jarvis custom commands to suit your specific needs.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Jarvis engages in smooth and interactive conversations.

## Installation

To use Jarvis AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/romer2010/ADVANCED-JARVIS.git
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd jarvis-ai
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application:

Usage
Once Jarvis is running, you can interact with it via the command line or integrate it into other applications. Simply type your query, and Jarvis will respond with helpful information or execute the task you've asked.

Example:
  ```bash
  User: What’s the weather today?
