# Jarvis AI

Jarvis is an AI assistant that I built to perform various tasks and provide useful information. It can handle a wide range of queries, from answering general knowledge questions to assisting with more complex tasks like scheduling, reminders, and more!

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Jarvis understands and processes human language to provide intelligent responses.
- **Task Automation**: It can perform tasks like setting reminders, making calculations, and more.
- **Knowledge Base**: Jarvis has access to a vast array of knowledge to answer general queries.
- **Custom Commands**: You can teach Jarvis custom commands to suit your specific needs.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Jarvis engages in smooth and interactive conversations.
